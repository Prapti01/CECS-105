<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Thank you for visiting my page! I was born in Bangladesh but was mostly raised in America. I speak 3 languages (Bengali, English, and Hindi) and love to read. My favorite author is Rick Riordan, and I mostly enjoy fantasy novels like Percy Jackson! I am really passionate about cooking, however, I know I cannot pursue this as a career at the moment. I love trying new foods and dishes, but nothing can beat a good burger and a side of well-seasoned fries. One fun fact about me is that I do not like drinking soda. I prefer to drink just water with my meals. When I feel fancy I like to add in lemon slices or other fruits. Currently, I am not sure what I want to study or what my career path should be, but I want to keep my options open.</p>
